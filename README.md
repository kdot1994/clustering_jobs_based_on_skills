# clustering_jobs_based_skills
The European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) framework has been developed by the European Commission and includes information on relationships between 2,942 occupations and 13,485 skills/competences. The following script clusters jobs based on similar skill sets togehter. For this task first a TD-IDF matrix is created. Afterwards, hierarchical clustering is done, with each iteration the two nearest data points are clustered togehter, till only a single cluster exists. The used technique can be visualized via a Dendrogram. Wordclouds are created for each cluster to have a better understanding of the created cluster and which job it might include. Afterwards, a simple classifier (Random Forest) is used to predict to which cluster a job belongs based on the given skills.
